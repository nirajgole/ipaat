7) What is a Topic? How did Kafka use the topic to communicate from the producer to the consumer? Is it possible to add a new partition to an existing Kafka Topic? Explain in detail
What is a Topic in Kafka?
Think of a topic as a category or channel in Kafka. It's a named stream of messages used to organize related data.
Producers publish messages (events, records) to specific topics.
Consumers subscribe to topics to receive the messages they're interested in.
Communication between Producers and Consumers:
Producers send messages to a chosen topic.
Kafka cluster (brokers) routes those messages to the appropriate topic.
Consumers subscribe to the topics they need.
Kafka delivers the messages from the subscribed topics to the consumers in the order they were published (within a partition).
Key Points:
Topics help organize data flow.
They enable scalability for high data volumes.
A topic can have multiple producers and consumers.
Messages are durable (stored on disk) for reliability.
Adding New Partitions to Existing Topics
Unfortunately, Kafka doesn't directly allow adding new partitions to existing topics after creation. Here are some workarounds, but they have limitations:
Manual Partition Reassignment (Downtime Required):
Create a new topic with the desired number of partitions.
Migrate existing data to the new topic partitions.
Consumers switch their subscriptions.
This process involves downtime and manual effort.
Third-party Tools (Limited Support):
Some tools claim to enable dynamic partition addition.
These solutions often have limitations or require extra setup.
They might not be officially supported by the Kafka community.
Summary:
Kafka topics offer a powerful way for distributed applications to communicate by categorizing data streams and facilitating efficient message flow.
